# credit-risk-classification

## Overview of the Analysis

* The purpose of this analysis was to use the provided dataset to predict whether a loan is healthy or at risk of defaulting, based on multiple credit-worthy factors of a borrower.
* The credit-worthy factors included loan size, interest rate, borrowers' income, debt-to-income ratio, number of accounts per borrower, derogatory marks (ex: late/missed payments, foreclosure, bankruptcy, etc.), and a borrower's total debt. This information is used to determine if a loan is in good standing or if it is at high risk of defaulting. This status is represented in binary, where 0 means a loan is in good standing, and 1 means a loan is high risk.
* To calculate the predictions, supervised machine learning techniques were used:
  * splitting into training and testing datasets;
  * logistics regression model;
  * validating the data score based on the logistics regression model;
  * make predictions;
  * calculate an accuracy score;
  * implement a confusion matrix and classification report to interpret the prediction results.

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:

* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
